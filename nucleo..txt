ADC read - parallel interface
 1. Pulse CONVST → ADC starts converting.
   -CONVST LOW ≥ 25 ns
   -CONVST HIGH  ≥ 25 ns
 2. BUSY goes HIGH during conversion.
 3. Wait until BUSY goes LOW → data is ready.
 4. Keep RD HIGH while BUSY is HIGH (don’t read yet).
 5. After BUSY goes LOW: Pull CS LOW & Pull RD LOW
 6. Latch/read DB[15:0] on the MCU.
 7. Bring RD HIGH (this advances to the next channel word) and do it for each channel.
 8. Finally bring CS HIGH when done.
